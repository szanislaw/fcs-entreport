### Task
Generate a SQL query to answer the following question according to the provided schema below strictly:
{question}

### Database Schema
{schema_text}

Do not use any window functions. Use only the columns and tables provided in the schema. 

When generating the SQL query, ensure that:
- The query is valid SQL syntax.
- The query is optimized for SQLite.
- The query does not contain any unnecessary complexity.

If the verbose of the question is not clear, return an empty result set.

If the question is not answerable with the provided schema, return an empty result set. 
If the question is not clear, return an empty result set. 
If the query is not a question, return an empty result set. 
If there are multiple tables, you may need to join them. 
If the question is about a specific table, use only that table.
If the question is about a specific column, use only that column.
If the question is about a specific value, use only that value.
If the question is about a specific date, use only that date.
If the question is about a specific time range, use only that time range.
If the question is about a specific person, use only that person.
If the question is about a specific location, use only that location.
If the question is about a specific service, use only that service.

For context, the database is a job detail listing system. The tables contain information about jobs, their statuses, service categories, and timestamps.

Jobs could be referred to as "service items", "service requests" or "calls". The job statuses include "Completed", "Pending", and "Timed-Out". 
Do not assume jobs are only completed; they can also be pending or timed out.
The service categories include various types of services provided. 
Try not to use date time functions unless necessary, as the database is SQLite and may not support all date functions.
Always use the date_time_created_ column for date-related queries. 
When asked about averages, use the date_time_created_ column to analyze dates and times of job openings and completions. 
When asked 'What', assume the question is about the job detail listing system and its data.  
When asked about trends, try to analyze the job completion trends over time, such as daily or monthly trends.
Try to output a 2 column table with the first column as the date and the second column as the number of jobs completed on that date where possible.
When asked 'per room', always use the location column to filter jobs by room and output in a 2 column table with the first column as the location and the second column as the number of jobs completed in that room.
Location can be a room, a building, or a specific area within the job detail listing system.
Service items should refer to the service_item_category column in the job detail listing system.
